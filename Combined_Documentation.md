# UGC Map

# UGC Map

## Overview

The UGC Map is a dedicated map designed for UGC (User-Generated Content) creations. Currently, it is unclear if additional maps will be introduced in future updates.

## Map Details

### Dimensions

- **Map Code**: *MOD_Main*
- **Size**: 2x2 km
- **Central Island**:
  - Dimensions: Approximately 400x400 m, elevated around 11 m above sea level
  - Features: Elevated cliffs around the edges.

### Boundaries

- **X and Y Axis**:
  - Bordered by an invisible wall
  - Players encountering the wall receive a message: "Outside of map"
  - Attempting to bypass the wall (e.g., via building or teleporting) results in instant transportation back to the edge
- **Z Axis (Height)**:
  - Limit: Several kilometers high
  - Building mode: Reaching the height limit may cause player death

### Rendering Behavior

- **Z Render Distance**: Approximately 1 km
- **Dynamic Loading**:
  - Assets load progressively as players ascend
  - Teleporting into an unloaded chunk may cause character glitches

## Visuals

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
  <img src="docs/.images//ugcMap.png" alt="UGC Map" style="max-height: 400px;"/>
  <img src="docs/.images//ugcMap_gameplay.png" alt="UGC Map Gameplay" style="max-height: 400px;"/>
</div>

## Notes for Creative Builders

- Teleporting into unloaded chunks can result in glitches.
- Consider the Z render distance and dynamic loading when designing teleportation paths.

# Objects

# Objects

## Description

Objects are the building and enviroment assets of your map. They allow you to create and customize environments, enabling creative designs like Parkour challenges.



---

# Devices Overview

# Devices

## Description

Devices are tools that add logic and interaction to your game modes.  
They enable dynamic gameplay elements such as triggers, spawn locations, items, and more.

Devices are a core element of any game mode to be created.  
Currently, there is a limit of 1000 devices in a single UGC map.

## Accessing the Device List

To access the device list:

- Press `P` to open the edit manager.
- In the **Object List** tab, navigate to the **Device** subtab.

<img src="docs/.images/Device_List.png" alt="Device List" style="max-height: 550px"/>

## Device Settings

### Open Settings

Each device has multiple settings to configure its behavior, you can access these settings in two ways:

- Press `F` while looking at the device in the world.
- Press `[` to open the Event Manager, select the device you want to edit, and click **Edit**.

### Settings

All devices have the following configuration sections:

<img src="docs/.images/Device_Settings.png" alt="Device List" style="max-height: 550px"/>

### Name

The name of the device, which defaults to its type and an incrementing number (e.g., `Player Spawn 1`).  
You can customize this name for clarity, limited to 30 alphanumeric characters.

---

### Basic

This tab contains all the main adjustable settings for the specific device.  
Some common settings are described [here](General/Common_Device_Settings.md).

---

### Change

This tab shows only the settings that you have changed from their default values, this allows for a quick review of your adjustments.

---

### Trigger

A trigger is an event from this device that can start an action on another device.

> If **this device** does `Trigger`, do `Action` on **another device**.

---

### Action

An action is a task that this device can perform when it receives a trigger from another device.

> Do `Action` on **this device** when a `Trigger` happens on **another device**.

---

*Note: A device can never Trigger an Action on itself.*

# Common Device Settings

## Activation Phase

Set the phase during which the device is activated:

- **None**: Activates only when triggered by an event.
- **Device Creation**: Activates immediately when the device is created.
- **Standby Before Spawn**: Activates during the standby phase before players spawn.
- **Standby After Spawn**: Activates during the standby phase after players spawn.
- **Round Start Before Spawn**: Activates at round start, before players spawn.
- **Round Start After Spawn**: Activates at round start, after players spawn.

> [!NOTE]  
> Activation phase is not to be confused with when the devices does something.  
> This setting is when the device itself is available (powered ON) to perform actions & trigger events.  

The different game phases is documented more in detail [here](../General/GamePhases.md).

## Target

Set the target to which the effect is applied:

- **All Players**: Applies to all players.
- **Selected Team**: Applies only to the selected team.
- **Selected Player**: Applies only to the selected player.
- **Tagged Players**: Applies only to players with the specified tag.

# GamePhases

# Game Phases

The game progresses through several distinct phases. Understanding these is crucial for configuring Device Activation Phases correctly.

## Creation

This is the initialization phase of the game mode, where all objects are loaded into the map.

## Standby

Once all objects are loaded, the game enters the Standby phase. This is often referred to as the "Warm-up Time" and has two sub-phases:

- **Before Spawn**: Activates during the standby phase before players spawn.
- **After Spawn**: Activates during the standby phase after players have spawned.

## Round

A match can consist of multiple rounds. At the start of each round, the following sub-phases occur:

- **Before Spawn**: Activates at the beginning of a round, before players spawn.
- **After Spawn**: Activates at the beginning of a round, after players have spawned. This is often referred to as the "Round Warm-up Time"

# SaveAndLoad

# Save and Load Instructions

## How to Load a File While In-Game
1. **Download** the `.pugc` file you wish to play.
2. **Load up** your UGC Lobby and start it.
3. **Press** `F10` (Alternatively, press `P` and then click `LOAD`).
4. **Click** `OPEN EXPLORER`.
5. **Drag and drop** the `.pugc` file you downloaded into this folder.

## How to Load a File Outside of the Game
1. **Download** the `.pugc` file you wish to play.
2. **Press** `Windows + R`.
3. **Type** `%localappdata%/tslGame/Saved/UGC` and hit Enter.
4. **Drag and drop** the `.pugc` file you downloaded into this folder.

After placing a `.pugc` in the correct folder, you do not need to restart the game or lobby.
Reopen the Load menu (`F10` or `P` and then click `LOAD`) and your new UGC file will be available.
