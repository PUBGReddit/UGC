## Copy-Paste across maps

### Important Note

Devices will reset to their default values, Props retrain their scaling/rotation/placement.

### Steps

1. Select the items you want to copy (e.g., a building, multiple buildings, logics, etc.).  
   (Use **R** for multi-selection.)
2. Copy the selected items by clicking the **Left Mouse Button**.
3. Press **F10** to load the map you want to paste onto.  
   (This only works with **F10**!)
4. Select and load the desired map.
5. You will still be holding the copied items, Simply paste them onto the new map.
