## Superscale Props

### Steps

1. Begin with a scaling factor of **1.0** across all axes.
2. Max out the scaling and place the object.
3. Cut the object and press **E** 3 times (yes, press **E** three times).
4. Place the object again.

### Incremental Adjustment

After superscaling, you can scale down incrementally on any axis to fine-tune the size.  
Available increments: **none**, **0.1**, **0.25**, **0.5**.
