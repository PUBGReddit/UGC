## Transform Properties 🔄

Every prop can be customized to fit your vision perfectly through rotation and scaling:

**Rotation:** Rotate props on any axis (X, Y, Z) to achieve the perfect angle and orientation for your design. This lets you create varied layouts even with the same prop types.

**Scaling:** Make props larger or smaller on all axes (X, Y, Z) to create size variations and unique visual effects. Scale down for miniature versions or scale up for dramatic focal points.

> **Creative Tip:** Combining rotation and scaling transforms basic props into completely different-looking elements, maximizing your design possibilities within the prop limits.
