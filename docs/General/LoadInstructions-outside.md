## How to Load a File Outside of the Game
1. **Download** the `.pugc` file you wish to play.
2. **Press** `Windows + R`.
3. **Type** `%localappdata%/tslGame/Saved/UGC` and hit Enter.
   - If you receive an error the folder does not exists.  
   Load into a UGC lobby first. This will have the game configure all folders correctly.
1. **Drag and drop** the `.pugc` file you downloaded into this folder.

After placing a `.pugc` in the correct folder, you do not need to restart the game or lobby.  
Reopen the Load menu (`F10` or `P` and then click `LOAD`) and your new UGC file will be available.
