# How to load and play a downloaded `.pubc` File
After **Downloading** the `.pugc` file you wish to play, you will need to store the file in the correct folder.
Follow one of these 2 options
 1. In-Game
    1. **Load up** your UGC Lobby and start it.
    2. **Press** `F10` (Alternatively, press `P` and then click `LOAD`).
    3. **Click** `OPEN EXPLORER`.
    4. **Drag and drop** the `.pugc` file you downloaded into this folder.
 2. Outside the Game
    1. **Press** `Windows + R`.
    2. **Type** `%localappdata%/tslGame/Saved/UGC` and hit Enter.
    3. **Drag and drop** the `.pugc` file you downloaded into this folder.

After placing a `.pugc` in the correct folder, you do not need to restart the game or lobby.
Reopen the Load menu (`F10` or `P` and then click `LOAD`) and your new UGC file will be available.
