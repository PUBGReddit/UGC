# PUBG REDDIT UGC Wiki

The purpose of this repository is to document how User-Generated Content (UGC) works in PUBG.  
Since there is no official PUBG documentation (yet), this community-built documentation aims to help players understand and create their own UGC maps.

## ✨ UGC (User Generated Content)

UGC provides players with **a creative space to build and customize their own worlds** within the game.  
Using Custom Match, you can design core rules, gameplay logic, and world-building elements like objects, crafting unique game modes that go beyond traditional battle royale gameplay. **UGC Alpha** is the first version of this creative toolkit.

## 📅 Availability UGC

Currently, UGC is available only to PUBG Partners, esports players, core creators, and competitive leaders.  
Starting in **August** (Update 37.1), **any player with a BATTLEGROUNDS Plus account** will be able to create UGC Alpha sessions in Custom Match.
